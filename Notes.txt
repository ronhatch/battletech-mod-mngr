Random details I wanted to remember... mostly how to read in different formats from Ruby.

require 'csv'
c = CSV.read 'VersionManifest.csv', {headers: true}
c[0]
c[-1]
c[-1].to_csv
c[0].to_csv
c[-2].to_csv
# Mangles the last line a bit, since the output has commas to delimit all fields.
c.to_csv
# Comments can be included using a regexp for the skip_lines parameter.
#   (But they don't seem to be supported by the reader HBS is using.)
# Allowing them in the ModManifest.csv file would be a useful feature.
c.headers
DateTime.parse(any timestamp field)

require 'json'
j = JSON.load File.read 'mech/mechdef_atlas_AS7-D.json'
j.class
j.keys
j['Description']
puts JSON.pretty_generate j, {indent: '    '}
# Comments are C-style:
#   /* Inline comments */
#   // Line comments
