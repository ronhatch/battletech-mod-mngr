When sanity checking:
  - Verify the following files and directories exist:
    [The configured path for BattleTech]
    BattleTech.exe
    BattleTech_Data directory
      StreamingAssets directory
        version.json
        [The configured mods directory]
        data directory
          VersionManifest.csv
          assetbundles directory
  - Verify the version.json file has just these keys:
    - ProductName (should be set to BattleTech)
    - ProductVersion
    - BuildRevision
    - BuildBranch
    - BuildDate
    - BuildStamp
    - BuildNumber
  - Verify the VersionManifest.csv file has just these columns:
    - id
    - type
    - path
    - version
    - addedOn
    - updatedOn
    - removedOn
    - assetBundleName
    - assetBundleCRC

When validating a mod:
  - Verify ModManifest.csv exists.
  - Verify ModManifest.csv has the correct case-sensitive filename.
  - Parsing ModManifest.csv should not trigger any errors.
  - Parsing failures of ModManifest.csv should give detailed error information.
  - ModManifest.csv and VersionManifest.csv should have the same column
    headings. (If the columns are in a different order, the code should handle
    it, and the final order should match VersionManifest.csv.)
  - Allow comments in ModManifest.csv.
  - For all lines in ModManifest.csv:
    - Verify any file referenced exists.
    - Verify referenced files use the correct case-sensitive filenames.
    - Verify anything contained in an asset bundle exists.
    - Parsing JSON files should not trigger any errors.
    - Parsing failures of JSON files should give detailed error information.
    - Parsing asset bundles should not trigger any errors.
    - Parsing failures of asset bundles should give detailed error information.
  - Verify ModData.json exists.
  - Verify ModData.json has the correct case-sensitive filename.
  - Parsing ModData.json should not trigger any errors.
  - Parsing failures of ModData.json should give detailed error information.

When installing a mod or multiple mods:
  - Run the validation first
  - The output CSV should not have any duplicate IDs.
  - All lines should be in the same order as in the original files.
  - All lines from each mod should come after the prior applied mods, if any.
  - A copy of VersionManifest.csv should be saved in OriginalManifest.csv.
  - Currently installed mods should be listed in CurrentMods.json.
